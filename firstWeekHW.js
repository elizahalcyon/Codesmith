// 4/5: Store your first name in a variable and your last name in another



// 6: Store your full name in a variable by adding the two variables



// UNCOMMENT THE LINE BELOW TO PRINT THE RESULT
// console.log(fullName);


// 7: Store your firstName, lastName, favColor and hometown in an object called myDetails

// 10: Write a loop that logs 'hello' to the console 10 times
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // code here
  
  }
  
  
  // 11: Use a WHILE loop to add 1 to 'count' 100 times
  let count = 0;
  // code here
  
  
  // Console log the new value of count
  
  
  // 12: Print the even numbers between 1 and 100
  
  
  // 13: Print your top five travel destinations to the console using a for loop.
  
  // BONUS
  // 14: Use your for loop to print the text from "mySpecialArray"
  //ex. if you used this loop on the array ['p','o','r','m','s','a','g','r'] you would see the text logged to the console that spelled "programs"
  
  const mySpecialArray = ["I","L","v"," ","o","e","m","t","h","i","s","d","C","e","o"," "];
  
  // loop goes here
  
  // 15: Create your loop here that will only log the 1st and every 3rd element of an array.
  //ex. if you used this loop on the array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] you would see the text logged to the console "0369"
  
  // loop goes here
